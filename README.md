## Goal

This project is a test- / playground for learning vue.js (Version 3) in combination with Typescript and [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/)

The requirements of the application were defined in the Dev-Jam discord community which can be found at [https://devjam.vercel.app/](https://devjam.vercel.app/). If you want some challenge for your evolving development skills, come and join us!

### Requirements

Implementation of an application using the Vigenere Cipher to encode input text based on a configurable cipher key.

### Personal adjustments

Since the basic implementation of the cipher algorithm was pretty straightforward, I decided to try and build a nostalgic desktop environment where input is provided by tying on a typewriter lookalike.

## Project Setup

### Local Development

- If you haven't installed yarn on your system yet, install it by running

  `$ npm i -g yarn`
- `$ yarn`
- `$ yarn dev`
- Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Publishing

I recommend [https://surge.sh](https://surge.sh) for deploying static web applications without a local database as it is so easy.

run `surge` to deploy the application to a subdomain of your choosing at `surge.sh`
